## Description

The idea behind this app came from the situations when we have been to friend's places and wanted to choose some music to play. A lot of the times our mates and ourselves will have some similar songs in common, but we don't want to spend the time building a playlist as we want to hang out with our mates. So, this is where the Spotify Party Playlist Maker comes in. Put in your user names of the friends involved and let us build the playlist for you whilst you get to hang out with your mates. Then play the playlist from the browser or 'follow' the playlist to add it to your own account.
